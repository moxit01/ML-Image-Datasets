## Image Datasets Links

* [Visual Genome](http://visualgenome.org/)

Visual Genome is a dataset, a knowledge base, an ongoing effort to connect structured image concepts to language which range from people, to buildings, to signs and lots more.

Contains:
108,077 Images,
5.4 Million Region Descriptions,
1.7 Million Visual Question Answers,
3.8 Million Object Instances,
2.8 Million Attributes,
2.3 Million Relationships.
Everything Mapped to Wordnet Synsets.

* [Image-Net](http://image-net.org/)

ImageNet is an image database organized according to the WordNet hierarchy (currently only the nouns), in which each node of the hierarchy is depicted by hundreds and thousands of images.

* [COCO](http://cocodataset.org/#download)

Common objects in context (COCO) is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.

Featuring:
Object segmentation,
Recognition in context,
Superpixel stuff segmentation,
330K images (>200K labeled),
1.5 million object instances,
80 object categories,
91 stuff categories,
5 captions per image,
250,000 people with keypoints.

* [LabelMe](http://labelme.csail.mit.edu/Release3.0/index.php?message=1)

The goal of LabelMe is to provide an online annotation tool to build image databases for computer vision research. You can contribute to the database by visiting the annotation tool.



* [Columbia University Image Library](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-100.php)

The Columbia University Image Library dataset features 100 different objects ranging from toys, personal care items, tablets and so on, imaged at every angle in a 360Â° rotation.

* [Open Images Dataset](https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/download.html)

These annotation files cover the 600 boxable object classes, and span the 1,743,042 training images where we annotated bounding boxes, object segmentations, visual relationships, and localized narratives; as well as the full validation (41,620 images) and test (125,436 images) sets.

* [Stanford Dogs Dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/)

The Stanford Dogs dataset contains images of 120 breeds of dogs from around the world. This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. 

Contents of this dataset:
Number of categories: 120  
Number of images: 20,580 
Annotations: Class labels, Bounding boxes

* [Indoor Scene Recognition](http://web.mit.edu/torralba/www/indoor.html)

Indoor scene recognition is a challenging open problem in high level vision. Most scene recognition models that work well for outdoor scenes perform poorly in the indoor domain. The main difficulty is that while some indoor scenes (e.g. corridors) can be well characterized by global spatial properties, others (e.g., bookstores) are better characterized by the objects they contain. More generally, to address the indoor scenes recognition problem we need a model that can exploit local and global discriminative information.
The database contains 67 Indoor categories, and a total of 15620 images. The number of images varies across categories, but there are at least 100 images per category. All images are in jpg format. The images provided here are for research purposes only.
